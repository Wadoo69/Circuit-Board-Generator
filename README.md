## Circuit Board Generator
This project is a simple circuit board generator implemented using JavaScript with p5.js for canvas drawing and dat.GUI for creating GUI controls. It allows you to dynamically generate and visualize circuit board layouts based on various parameters such as cell size, wire length, cut-off length, and straightness.

## Features
- Generate circuit board layouts dynamically.
- Adjust parameters such as cell size, wire length, cut-off length, and straightness using GUI controls.
- Real-time visualization of circuit board layouts.
